    <h1>One more light</h1>
    <h3>by Linkin park</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
    Should've stayed, were there signs I ignored?
    Can I help you not to hurt anymore?
    We saw brilliance when the world was asleep
    There are things that we can have, but can't keep if they say

    who cares if one more light goes out
    In the sky of a million stars? It flickers, flickers
    Who cares when someone's time runs out
    If a moment is all we are? Or quicker, quicker?
    Who cares if one more light goes out?
    Well, I do

    The reminders pull the floor from your feet
    In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
    And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
    Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there if they say

    Who cares if one more light goes out
    In the sky of a million stars? It flickers, flickers
    Who cares when someone's time runs out
    If a moment is all we are? Or quicker, quicker?
    Who cares if one more light goes out?
    Well, I do

    Who cares if one more light goes out
    In the sky of a million stars? It flickers, flickers
    Who cares when someone's time runs out
    If a moment is all we are? Or quicker, quicker?
    Who cares if one more light goes out?
    Well, I do
    Well, I do
